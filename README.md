Phase 1 uses the open source model DriveLMMo1.
The download link is https://huggingface.co/ayeshaishaq/DriveLMMo1.  
It should be noted that when loading the model for the first time, a problem of "mixed use of tabs and spaces for indentation" may be reported in a Python file, need to locate and fix it yourself.
