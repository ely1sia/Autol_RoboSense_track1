It's moving, so the vehicle should maintain its speed to follow the traffic flow.\n\n**Final Answer**: Firstly notice that green container at front camera. The object is stationary, so the ego vehicle should slightly offset to the left in maneuvering. Secondly notice that black sedan at right camera. The object is stationary, so the ego vehicle should keep going ahead at the same speed. Thirdly notice that black car at back camera. The object is going ahead, so the ego vehicle should keep going ahead at the same speed."}]}

The road markings indicate a straight path, and there are no signs of congestion or potential hazards. The probability of continuing at the same speed is high due to the absence of any immediate safety concerns or traffic signals requiring a change in speed. The environment appears calm and orderly, supporting the decision to proceed without alteration.\n\n**Final Answer**: The action is to keep going at the same speed because there is no safety issue. The probability of taking this action is high."}]}

This pattern is distinct from rain, which would typically show streaks or droplets. It is also not consistent with bit errors, which would likely cause random pixel distortions rather than a uniform pattern. Furthermore, H.256 ABR compression artifacts would typically manifest as blockiness or banding, not as a speckled pattern.

Traffic signs are typically larger and have standardized shapes and colors to convey specific messages.

The image shows a night scene with limited visibility due to poor lighting and potential glare from oncoming traffic.\n2. The road appears to be clear of obstacles, but the lack of visibility increases the risk of unseen hazards.\n3. To maintain safety, the ego vehicle should avoid sudden movements that could lead to loss of control.\n4.
